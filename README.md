This repository contains Group14's solution to the 2017 System Integration blockchain assignment.

## Project requirements

### General

* The blockchain has to be able to run on a network of distributed nodes (containers, virtual machines or cloud machines).

* It should be possible to perform simple blockchain *actions*. Examples include:
  * Adding transactions
  * Block mining
    * At least two versions for mining - used for Proof of Work.

### Formal

* The network has to be P2P network (peer-to-peer).

* The blockchain network should contain at least four (4) nodes.

* A reproducible setup is required. In this case, a bash script that instantiates the blockchain with example nodes and executes a test scenario.

* A screencast or screendumps that demonstrate the blockchain functionality.

* References for **all** information sources used for development/implementation.

### Optional

* User interface.
