# Blockchain - Group14

This repository contains Group14's solution to the 2017 System Integration [blockchain assignment](https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2017fall-system-integration-teaching-material/blob/e7729438dd0a3fa1c4cbc2a7b1d3651e8fc4600f/lecture_notes/12-Blockchain_Intro.ipynb).

## Project requirements

### General

* The blockchain has to be able to run on a network of distributed nodes (containers, virtual machines or cloud machines).
* It should be possible to perform simple blockchain *actions*. Examples include:
  * Adding transactions.
  * Block mining.
    * At least two versions for mining - used for Proof of Work.

### Formal

* The network has to be P2P network (peer-to-peer).
* The blockchain network should contain at least four (4) nodes.
* A reproducible setup is required. In this case, a bash script that instantiates the blockchain with example nodes and executes a test scenario.
* A screencast or screendumps that demonstrate the blockchain functionality.
* References for **all** information sources used for development/implementation.

### Optional

* User interface.

## Own specifications

* We are writing the blockchain in [Go](https://golang.org/#).
* We are using --TBD-- for our network of nodes.
